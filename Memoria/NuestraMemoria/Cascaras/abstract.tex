\section*{\tituloPortadaEngVal}

This undergrad thesis aims to create a desktop app called \appName{} enabling users to effortlessly craft thematic music for their video games, sans any prior musical knowledge. Through the use and study of fields such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, we will drive the generation of musical themes meeting the app's expectations. \appName{} interfaces with \textit{Reaper}, a third-party DAW empowering professional audio track creation and editing, by adding necessary instruments and filters to sound the AI-generated music.
